## Usage:
I have no intention to further develop this project, so feel free to use and modify any code.
That being said however, only beats have been implemented so far. Sliders and Spinners will need to be added, however I would recommend starting from scratch and building a much more optimised system to further develop this project, rather then modifying this code.
